      <p class="paraFont">Thalaramba Sri Indasra Maha Vidyalaya is a mixed school located in Thalaramba, Matara, Sri Lanka. The school was started by Rev.Thalaramba Indasara in 20<sup>th</sup> January 1941. At that time Mr.Punchisinyo and Mr. A.M. Aranolis manager made all arrangements with their other business partners to pay salaries for the teachers from their money. After that the school was taken over by the government on 01<sup>st</sup> of May 1942. At that time the school area was 117 perches.
      Although the school was named as Thalaramba Indasara Vidyalaya in 1966 Minister B.Y.Thudawa intervened and made it as a Thalaramba Indasara Maha Vidyalaya in 1976.<br>
      Back in 2012, this school was converted into a primary school and grades 6-11 were started in this school with the dedication of the then principal Mr.Layanal Hettiarachchi and the vice principal Rev.Kamburugamuwa Gunarathana.<br>
      Thalaramba Indasara Maha Vidyalaya developed in this way has now managed to create students who have acheived many acheivements as well as in external fields such as sports. The dedication of the teaching staff to raise the school like this is satisfactory.

          <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">With the courage and strength of early students it wasn't a trouble to win the obstacles. As a result of that, in 1942 Thalaramba Indasara vidyalaya became a government school. We should specially mention about all Buddhists who supported to start and lead the school as external parties, such as Rev. Thalaramba Indasara. Now in Thalaramba Sri Indasara Maha Vidyalaya there are about 200 students and 23 in academic staff with 12 in non-academic staff.</p>
