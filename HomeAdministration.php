                      <p class="card-text paraFont"> On the occassion of Thalaramba Sri Indasara Maha Vidyalaya's 83<sup>rd</sup> anniversary, we have started creating a website called the school as an initiative to fulfill the duties and responsibilities that 
                        should be fulfilled for the advancement of the students as the principal, and blending of the current education system with modern technology. The student is bound to the school by making all the 
                        information of the school known and seen by all. I also congratulate the three children who are studying higher education who are performing those tasks.<br>
                        Also, I respect the teaching staff and non-teaching staff who are dedicated to encouraging the students and uplifting the school. Because our effort is that school will develop day by day and a good genertaion of students will be born from the school.
                        <br>Thank You.
